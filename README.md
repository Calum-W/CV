I'm a graduate of Makers Academy, a highly-selective programming bootcamp that produces work-ready software developers. During the 16-week course, I have learned the core concepts of programming and strategies to rapidly pick up new langauges and frameworks.

Makers Academy has also engrained in me the importance of best coding practices, so I'm looking to work in an environment that follows these principles and values good craftmanship in code. Ideally, an ambitious company that offers exciting challenges as well as support, and I can grow to become a key member of the team.


## Skills

#### Communication

As an English teacher in Asia for seven years, my capacity for clearly expressing complicated concepts was key to my students' success, as well as boosting my early ability to speak Mandarin and Japanese before developing a larger vocabulary.

Through delivering thousands of group classes and one-to-one lessons, I have fine-tuned my ability to present information in an engaging and concise manner to individuals or large groups. After attending my group seminars on topics from business writing to negotiation, many senior executives at EY Tokyo came to me for guidance with presentations they themselves had to give in English.

#### Fast learner
During twelve weeks at Makers' Academy, I went from knowing very little about programming to building and testing whole projects in a variety of languages. This gave me the confidence to suggest learning completely unfamiliar languages to build each of my final group projects in.

Once promoted to head of English development at EY Japan, I changed my team's system from template business English lessons to an adaptive approach in which we tailored our own lessons to each employee's individual needs, which often involved discussing the intricacies of tax reforms or inheritance laws, or role-playing current clients or financial authorities. Cramming the financial knowledge required to deliver each of these sessions effectively was challenging, but as a result, demand for English lessons rocketed and I was forced to impose quotas on each department.

## Interests
- My interest in **photography** began as a hobby, but as my instagram following grew I began to receive commercial offers and have gone on to complete assignments for brands such as Flipbelt, Manulife and Instagram. [(Instagram profile)](https://www.instagram.com/acowinjapan/)
- Another passion I've been lucky enough to monetise is **writing**, having freelanced regularly for outlets such as Time Out and the Japanese National Tourism Organisation. [(Portfolio)](https://www.clippings.me/users/calwiddall)
- As well as sci-fi novels, I love **reading** non-fiction books related to my life, such as the histories of cities I lived in, or linguistics when I was teaching English and learning Mandarin/Japanese. Since discovering programming, I've devoured a stack of books on tech, which have helped me understand the industry and kept me sane on my 90-minute commute to Makers Academy.
